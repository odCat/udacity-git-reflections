Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A: I save remotely when I work on something from multiple places/machines. Or when I
want to have the project backed up or when I want it public, for other to see.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Once you start working on a project you don't want it to change in ways it
might or might not affect your work. It is my opinion it is better to pull
manually after you are finished.
