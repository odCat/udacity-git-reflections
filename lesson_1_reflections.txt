How did viewing a diff between two version of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It allowed me to look directly at the changes made to the working version.

How could having easy access to the entire hisotry of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Accessing the entire history of a file would alow me to find the newly introduced bugs fast and specnt the time on actually fixing them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The pros of manually commiting are: you have control of when the commits are made and you can make sure they are working commits; secondly you can choose the commits so they are made at logical points, so it is easy to undersdand the project and its progression.
The con of manually commiting is that is prone to error.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Version control systems like Git are use to manage big projects made of many files. I such cases changes made in one file will require mirrowing changes in other files. On the other side, systems like Google Docs are specialized in managing silgle file documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You use git log to see the commits and their description and then git diff to see the chances made between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
When using a version control system it is very easy and time efficient to find and reveart a damaging change.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what doyou want to try using Git for?
First I will use Git to experiment and try to understand it better.
