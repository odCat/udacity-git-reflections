What happens whn you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
The .git folder gets created. The folder tells git that a reporsitory is present and it shoud keep track of file changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediary state between the working directory and the repository; it is the only part of the working directory that will be committed to the repository, but until the next commit is still not part of the repository.
The staging area provides flexibility; A commit can contain only a part of the total changes made to the working directory, while the rest might be commited later; this can help maintain the logical consistency of the commits.
Also the commit process is resource efficient because it takes in only the staged changes instead of the whole directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
You make sure by staging only the changes that make a logical unit first, then
commit them. Then you repeat the process with another set of changes etc.
